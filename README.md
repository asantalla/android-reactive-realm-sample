The aim of this project is to provide a simple example on how to observe a Realm entity and auto-update some view/s.

Dependencies
------------

- Kotlin: 1.1.3-2
- RxKotlin: 2.1.0
- RxAndroid: 2.0.1
- Realm: 3.5.0

Limitations
-----------

Due to a Realm dependency with RxJava 1, if you use RxJava 2 or RxKotlin 2 you can't use the default methods to convert queries to Observables provided by the Realm library.

You can see more information in [this Realm project issue ticket](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/3497).

How to auto-update a view observing Realm entity changes
--------------------------------------------------------

This a common functionality of many Android applications. For example, if you have a *functionality to mark some entity as favorite* you can achieve this using this technique.

Due to the limitation above commented, we have to create an **Observable** manually and add the Realm entity change listener on it. For example:

```kotlin
return Observable.create<Book> { observer ->
    object : HandlerThread("realm") {

        override fun onLooperPrepared() {
            super.onLooperPrepared()

            val realm = Realm.getDefaultInstance()
            val handler = Handler()
            handler.post {
                realm.where(Book::class.java).equalTo("title", title).findFirst().addChangeListener<Book> { book, _ ->
                    observer.onNext(realm.copyFromRealm(book))
                }
            }
        }
    }.start()
}
```

Now, we can subscribe to the above **Observable** and updates the view every time the Realm entity is updated.
